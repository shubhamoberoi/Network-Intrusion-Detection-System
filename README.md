# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System

# Developed a network intrusion detector using logistic regression, KNN, SVM, Fully Connected Neural Networks.
# The Predictive Model can distinguish between bad connections called intrusion and good normal ones.
# Best Accuracy obtained was for KNN model which is 93.01%.
